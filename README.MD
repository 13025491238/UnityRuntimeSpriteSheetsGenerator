Unity Runtime SpriteSheets Generator
====================================

Unity and plugins provide many great ways to build Sprite Sheets. However they're used directly into Unity Editor or with an external software which is perfect in many case, but none provide the ability to generate SpriteSheets at runtime.

The RectanglePacking algorithm is a port of the AS3 version made by [Ville Koskela](https://github.com/villekoskelaorg/RectanglePacking). Assets used in the demo come from [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/).
